## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- [#943](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/943) [`f485e4a`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/f485e4a23cf3756b9e628cf2d9242fbc0b3da178) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **One auth model across OpenAPI, GraphQL, and MCP**
  - Every protocol plugin now stores the same placements-based auth methods (the new `@executor-js/sdk/http-auth` vocabulary): an API-key method carries any mix of header and query placements, each rendered from its own credential input — so one source can declare OAuth, a bearer-header-plus-team-id-query method, a plain bearer, and a query token side by side, and one connection can carry several values (e.g. both Datadog keys).
  - MCP and GraphQL gain what only OpenAPI could do before: multi-placement methods, query-parameter credentials (servers like ui.sh's `?token=`), and multi-input connections. Rendering, catalog projection, slug normalization, and the React method editor/codec are shared instead of triplicated; the connect modal collects one value per input.
  - Invoking with an unresolvable credential input now fails with `connection_value_missing` (naming the missing inputs) instead of silently dialing unauthenticated.
  - Stored integration configs are rewritten to the canonical shape by a one-off migration: local and self-host run it automatically at startup; cloud operators run `bun run db:migrate-auth:prod` before deploying. Connection bindings and stored credential values are preserved exactly.
  - Authoring: apikey methods are authored in ONE request-shaped dialect on every plugin — it reads like the request it produces: `{ type: "apiKey", headers: { Authorization: ["Bearer ", variable("token")] }, queryParams: { team_id: [variable("team_id")] } }` (`variable()` is exported from each plugin; a plain-string value is a static literal). Inputs normalize to the canonical placements model, which is what stored configs and the catalog read as. Authoring is strict where the renderer is: a value carries at most one variable, as the final part.
  - Every method is keyed by `kind` — OpenAPI's oauth templates re-key from the retired `type: "oauth"` spelling to `kind: "oauth2"` (matching MCP/GraphQL); the one-off migration rewrites stored entries.
  - Breaking (wire): the retired single-placement inputs (`headerName` on MCP, `in`/`name` on GraphQL), raw canonical-placement inputs, and `type: "oauth"` oauth inputs are rejected. The `mcp.addServer` singular `auth` shorthand still works.

- [#950](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/950) [`dbb48ec`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/dbb48ec99e923b15cc39fa5041887566f4a6d2d0) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix: workspace connections were resolvable only by whoever created them**

  The WorkOS Vault credential provider filed a credential's metadata under the _acting user's_ private partition instead of the credential's own owner. Org-shared connections (and OAuth tokens, and OAuth client secrets) created by one member therefore resolved only for that member — every other member of the workspace hit `connection_value_missing` ("no resolvable credential value") even though the key was saved correctly. The provider now partitions by the owner embedded in the credential's item id (`connection:org:…` → org-shared, `connection:user:…` → private), so a key pasted by one member works for the whole workspace. Pre-existing mis-filed metadata is repaired by a one-off cloud migration (`db:repartition-vault:prod`); the stored secret value itself was never affected.

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- [#939](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/939) [`db09372`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/db093728ad1752d25a577cd7f89b705a3915a2d2) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Desktop packaging follow-ups from the v1.5.2 release run:
  - Fixed the Intel mac desktop build failing in CI (the cross-target dependency install was being glob-expanded by the shell).
  - Fixed the first-launch data migration on Windows: renaming the previous database file could hit a transient `EBUSY` while the just-closed SQLite handle was released, so the move now retries briefly instead of failing startup.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- [#936](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/936) [`2db9d65`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/2db9d65a828615c2ec0b209d54616dbf4264fefd) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Desktop**
  - Fixed the desktop app failing to launch: the packaged sidecar was missing its native SQLite and keychain bindings, so the local server exited before the window appeared. The release pipeline now smoke-tests the compiled sidecar before publishing.
  - Mac auto-updates now serve the correct architecture — the arm64 and x64 update manifests previously collided, so Apple Silicon machines could be offered Intel builds.
  - If the local server fails to start, the app now shows the error (with a pointer to the log) and installs any available update on quit, instead of closing silently.

  **Integrations & auth**
  - Integrations can declare multiple authentication methods in every plugin. MCP servers join the slugged template model used by OpenAPI and GraphQL, so a server can offer OAuth and an API key side by side, and adding a custom method appends instead of replacing a detected one. Existing connections keep working with no migration.
  - OAuth app management is folded into the connect modal, so client setup happens where accounts are added.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#927](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/927) [`df40cd3`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/df40cd3716254daff0343ace7c2de7d46756d0f5) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Fix `executor web` crashing with `no such table: plugin_storage` when upgrading from an older v1 release. The v1 → v2 data migration now replays the bundled legacy schema migrations first, so databases last touched by any pre-1.5 version are brought up to the final v1 schema before their data is migrated.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c7bb2a4`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/c7bb2a4da99aac4199b424d6d52e6ea843250e3a) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Integrations and connections rework.

  **Highlights**
  - Sources are now split into integrations (the API surface) and connections (the credential). One integration can hold many connections — workspace-shared or personal — and each connection gets its own tool catalog.
  - Tool addresses carry the connection, so agents can target a specific account: `tools.vercel_api.org.workspace.deploy` vs `tools.vercel_api.user.personal.deploy`.
  - Existing data migrates automatically on first launch: sources become integrations, secrets and credential bindings become connections, OAuth apps and tool policies carry over, and the previous database is kept as a backup next to the new one.
  - Public no-auth servers (MCP, GraphQL) connect without entering a credential.
  - Connections display the signed-in identity, so you can tell accounts apart at a glance.
  - The CLI, local web app, and desktop app can connect to a shared Executor server instead of each running their own; the desktop app persists server profiles across restarts.
  - Self-hosted Executor now publishes a multi-architecture GHCR image at `ghcr.io/rhyssullivan/executor-selfhost` (stable releases tagged `latest`, prereleases tagged `beta`).

  **Reliability**
  - OpenAPI, GraphQL, and MCP tools return structured authentication failures with recovery guidance instead of opaque internal errors — covering missing credentials, expired OAuth connections, upstream 401/403 responses, and MCP per-user isolation.
  - OAuth popups complete more reliably in Chrome by preserving the callback channel through the same-origin completion page.
  - OAuth Dynamic Client Registration data is reused across retries and reconnects, including scopes, so providers are not asked to register duplicate clients.
  - Creating a connection with invalid input (no credential for a credentialed method, mixed input origins) returns a clear error with the reason instead of an opaque internal error.
  - The v1 → v2 migration creates connections for no-auth sources, derives OAuth authorize endpoints when v1 only stored a bare issuer origin, keys inline header values per source, and skips malformed credential bindings with a warning instead of silently dropping them. An unreachable OAuth metadata endpoint no longer blocks the migration on launch.
  - Google sources use a bundled OpenAPI flow with valid schemas.
  - MCP tool output schemas match the actual invocation result envelope, including `content`, `structuredContent`, `_meta`, and `isError`.
  - Integration icons survive migration, connected presets show their icons, and credentials show a loading badge while resolving.

  **Breaking changes**
  - Tool addresses gained two segments for the connection's owner and name: `tools.vercel_api.deploy` is now `tools.vercel_api.org.workspace.deploy`. Saved tool policies are rewritten automatically during migration; agent code that hard-codes v1.4 addresses needs the new shape (`tools.search()` returns ready-to-call paths).
  - The Google Discovery plugin was removed. Google integrations now go through the bundled Google flow; existing Google sources migrate automatically.
