// Better Auth instance over the SAME libSQL `file:` URL as the FumaDB executor
// tables ("one file, two schema regions").
//
// Schema-at-boot: passing `{ dialect: new LibsqlDialect({ url }), type: "sqlite" }`
// makes Better Auth's createKyselyAdapter take its `"dialect" in db` branch (no
// native dep, no bun:sqlite); `runMigrations()` creates the auth tables
// idempotently in that file. `makeAuthOptions` is the single source of truth so
// the migrator and runtime instance never drift.
//
// CRITICAL: LibsqlDialect opens its OWN libSQL connection to the file — it does
// NOT share SelfHostDb's drizzle connection. Both target one file, and a row
// Better Auth writes via this dialect is immediately readable through the
// drizzle/FumaDB client (proven by seed.ts's reads + better-auth.test.ts). The
// per-connection foreign_keys/WAL PRAGMAs SelfHostDb set on its own connection
// do NOT carry to this one; for the auth tables that is fine (Kysely issues no
// FK-dependent reads at boot and WAL is already a file-level mode), and the
// shared file stays consistent because writes go through SQLite's file lock.
//
// We build exactly ONE auth instance, held for the process lifetime. An earlier
// design built a throwaway "bootstrap" instance to run migrations + seed before
// the org id was known, then discarded it — but its LibsqlDialect connection
// (a DIFFERENT native libSQL build than SelfHostDb's) was GC-closed mid-boot,
// and that close unlinked the shared `-wal` out from under SelfHostDb's
// still-open connection. Every executor write then landed in a deleted WAL
// inode and vanished on the next restart (the "reconnected account, zero tools"
// data-loss bug). Keeping one long-lived auth connection — with the org id
// late-bound the same way the signup gate's `getAuth` already is — removes the
// discarded connection entirely. NEVER call .destroy() during normal operation;
// SelfHostDb owns the file lifecycle and closes its client at shutdown.
//
// `satisfies BetterAuthOptions` (not a return annotation) keeps the literal
// plugin tuple so `betterAuth` infers the plugin-augmented `auth.api` and
// session/user shapes (activeOrganizationId, role, createUser, ...).

 * One instance, not two: the org id the session-pin and gate need isn't known
 * until the seed creates the org, but both read it lazily (a ref, like the
 * gate's `getAuth`), so there's no need for a throwaway bootstrap instance —
 * and so no second libSQL connection to be GC-closed mid-boot and unlink the
 * shared WAL (see the header comment; that was the self-host data-loss bug).
 *
 * The gate is active during the seed, but its hooks only act on the
 * `/sign-up/email` path — the seed's admin `createUser`/`createOrganization`
 * pass straight through, exactly as the old gate-free bootstrap instance did.
 *
 * `url` is the SAME libSQL `file:` URL SelfHostDb opened; `client` is
 * SelfHostDb's drizzle connection to that file, used by the seed for its two
 * idempotency reads against the auth tables Better Auth just migrated (proving
 * the cross-connection invariant: Better Auth writes via LibsqlDialect are
