 * its own endpoint root domains is in that union. This deliberately matches at
 * the registrable-domain level (not full host, not full PSL gymnastics): a
 * provider commonly splits authorize/token across sibling hosts on one root
 * (e.g. `accounts.google.com` + `oauth2.googleapis.com` are DIFFERENT roots, so
 * a provider that declares both has both in its union, and an app declaring
 * either matches). Unrelated providers (different root) never match.
 *
 * When the integration declares no endpoints, every app is "matched" (no filter).
